# JavaScript Learning Journey - Riwi Academy

This repository tracks my progress through the JavaScript module, covering everything from core logic to full-stack integration with REST APIs.

## User Stories Overview

### 1. Interactive Messaging System (Week 1)
**Focus:** Variables, Data Types, and Logic.
- Created an interactive program using `prompt()`, `alert()`, and `console.log()`.
- Implemented **Input Validation** to ensure the user's age is a valid number.
- Developed dynamic conditional logic to display personalized messages based on age groups.

### 2. Advanced Data Structures (Week 2)
**Focus:** Objects, Sets, and Maps.
- Developed a data management system using **JavaScript Objects** to represent products.
- Leveraged **Sets** to automatically handle data uniqueness and **Maps** to create associations between categories and products.
- Applied `for...in` and `for...of` loops to efficiently iterate through complex data collections.

### 3. DOM Manipulation & Persistence (Week 3)
**Focus:** User Interface and Browser Storage.
- Built a dynamic Note List application using the **DOM API** (`appendChild`, `removeChild`).
- Integrated **Local Storage** to ensure data persists even after refreshing the page, using `JSON.stringify` and `JSON.parse`.
- Implemented real-time UI updates with `textContent` and basic form validation.

### 4. Full-Stack Mini-App (Week 4 - Final Project)
**Focus:** Fetch API, Async/Await, and CRUD.
- Designed an integrated web application for **Product Management**.
- **CRUD Integration:**
    - **GET:** Syncing data from a JSON Server.
    - **POST:** Adding new records to a remote database.
    - **DELETE:** Removing items from both the server and the UI.
- Used **Async/Await** with `try...catch` blocks for professional error handling during network requests.

## Tech Stack
